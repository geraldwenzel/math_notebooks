    "# Solving Cubic Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a handful of strategies that can be used to solve cubic equations. The strategies range from recognizing polynomials in a particular form to more complex procedures that involve multiple steps. The different methods of solving a cubic equation can be tried from simplest to most complex until a method is found that works. The techniques below are listed from the simplest to the most complex.
